Build, operate, maintain, and secure the most robust, decentralized network ever imagined.

Such a disruptive technology and end-goal is going to face a lot of resistance from governments, banking, current internet giants, other cryptocurrencies, and user acceptance.   The Tron SR is going to have to build a redundant, multi-server, multi-location, secure, automatic failover, Ddos protected environment with multiple engineers supporting around the clock operations.  

The below diagram gives a basis view of our network design.  At any given time, it might scale up or down, but follows the same concepts.

During test net operations, we produces over 100k block and our bandwidth consumption was under 10%, our processors ran an average of 4% utilization, while 22% of our RAM was consumed. This gives us room to grow without the need for network redesign, but at a reasonable starting price.
