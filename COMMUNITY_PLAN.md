Our entire approach to the Super Representative position is based on one simple question.   As an investor and holder in TRX, which of the following best describe your goal? In our opinion, it is not even close, and the answer for most is number two.  

  1.	To earn small annual return on my investment via vote staking.
  
  2.	For Tron to reach its maximum potential, and have my investment grow by 10x, 100x or even 1000x.
  
We believe that Super Representatives have a primary responsibility and it must be taken very seriously.  That responsibility is to build, operate, maintain, and secure the most robust, decentralized network ever imagined.  This network is not going to be like other blockchains.  This is not a network where a single individual runs a master node or staking pool server from their home or office.  Such a disruptive technology and end-goal is going to face a lot of resistance from governments, banking, current internet giants, other cryptocurrencies, and user acceptance.   The Tron SR is going to have to build a redundant, multi-server, multi-location, secure, automatic failover, Ddos protected environment with multiple engineers supporting around the clock operations.  Such an operation can easlily cost over 1 million a year to operate.

We believe, that until we overcome these challenges, that our focus should be to invest in these solutions.  And only after we accomplish all these goals, should rewards be paid back to coin holders. If SR don't properly use their funds to solve these challenges and instead pay large dividends for votes, they are risking the entire Tron project, as are the voters who vote for such models.  We need to think long-term if we are going to have the success that we all crave.

As a result, we will put our first 2 million in block rewards back into the network. And then, do the same with the first million each year after that.  We need to build a Tron army of the best and brightest technical team.  Once we do that, we will gladly paying additonal reveunes back to voters, or simply burn TRX.  We intend to execute on the following:

1. Create a best practices guide. To cover network architecture, sys admin, node configuration, security, DDos protection, network monitoring, log analysis, emergency procedures, wallet operation, Dapp basics.

2.  Build and operate a public Tron test net. This will allow aspiring engineers the opportunity to configure servers, build blocks, monitor logs, and eventually become Super Representatives.

3.  We want to lead the effort to bring Tron to every country on the planet.  We will work with aspiring engineers from all over the world and help fund the hardware and bandwidth needed to so they can install and maintain a full-node on the Tron network.

4. Create internships and scholarships for aspiring engineers that want to learn TRX technology.

5. Create forums / support channels / instructional videos for aspiring Tron engineers.
