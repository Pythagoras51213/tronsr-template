Our entire approach to the Super Representative position is based on one simple question.   As an investor and holder in TRX, which of the following two best describe your goals? In our opinion, it is not even close, and the answer is number two.  

  1.	To earn small annual return on my investment via vote staking.
  2.	For Tron to reach its maximum potential, and have my investment grow by 10x, 100x or even 1000x.
  
We believe that Super Representatives have a primary responsiblity and it must be taken very seriously.  That responsiblity is to build, operate, maintain, secure, and protect the most robust, decentralized network ever built.  This network is not going to be like other blockchains.  This is not a network where 1-2 man teams run a masternode or staking pool server from thier home or office.  Such a disruptive technology and end-goal is going to face a lot of resistance from governments, banking, current internet giants, and user acceptance.   We believe, that until we overcome all of these challenges, that our focus should be to invest in these solutions.  And only after, should rewards be paid back to coin holders.

As a result, our community effort for the first two years, will be solely to get us prepared for these challenges.  We need to build a Tron army of the best and brightest technical team.  We intend to execute on the following:

1. Create a best practices guide. To cover network acrhitecture, sys admin, node configuration, security, DDos protection, network monitoring, log analysis, emergency procedures, wallet operation, Dapp basics.
2. Create forums / support channels for apsiring Tron engineers.
3. Create internships and scholarships for aspiring engineers that want to learn TRX technology.
4. Build a public Tron testnet. This will allow aspiring engineers the opportunity to configure servers, build blocks, monitor logs, and eventually become Super Representatives.
