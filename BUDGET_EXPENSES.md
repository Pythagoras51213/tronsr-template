Our start-up working capital for this venture is between $50,000 and $200,000, as needed.

Budgeting for this venture is extremely difficult.  Any good budget also must include a revenue projection.  As a Tron SR, you can get voted in and out, so it is difficult to predict income.  Additionally, the price of TRX fluctuates, so even if you knew your TRX income, you can not predict your fiat income.

Therefore, any budget that states we will use x % for infrastructure, or y % for community outreach, or z % for voter dividends is faulty from the start.   If revenues are low, surely a higher % needs to be used for infrastructure, and if TRX price is high, surely a lower % is needed for infrastructure, so a higher % can be used for community outreach. With that said, I will make some assumptions, so we can provide some numbers.

Let’s start with the 5 billion block rewards that are paid annually.  Let’s assume there are 75 top SR candidates that get rotated in on an equal basis – this is desirable to keep standby SRs funded, active, and ready to produce blocks at a moments notice.  That is 66,666,666 TRX per SR candidate, and at $0.10 per TRX, that is just over 6M annual revenue, or 500k per month. At that funding, we would be at phase 2 or 3 of our infrastructure development, and our budget would look as follows:
